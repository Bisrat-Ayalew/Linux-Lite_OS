# Installation
This project documents the installation of Linux Lite 7.0 on Oracle VirtualBox and explores key system programming concepts. Linux Lite, a lightweight Ubuntu-based distribution, was chosen for its performance on low-spec hardware and user-friendly interface. The report includes a detailed walkthrough of the installation steps, hardware/software requirements, and issues faced during setup. It also covers filesystem support, advantages and limitations of Linux Lite, and its suitability for educational and development environments. The goal is to provide a beginner-friendly platform for learning system-level programming using open-source tools.
# System call
This project demonstrates the implementation of the mkdir() system call in C within a Linux Lite 7.0 environment. It begins with a brief overview of system calls and their role in enabling user applications to interact with the OS kernel. The core focus is on using mkdir() to programmatically create directories with specified permissions, along with error handling for common issues. A sample C program is provided and tested in the terminal, showcasing successful directory creation and failure scenarios like name conflicts.
